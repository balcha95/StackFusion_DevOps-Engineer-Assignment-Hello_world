# DevOps Project

This project focuses on various aspects of DevOps practices and technologies. It includes tasks related to infrastructure provisioning, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), monitoring and logging, and working with Kubernetes and microservices architecture.

## Task 1: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Using a configuration management tool of your choice (such as Ansible, Puppet, or Chef), create an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solution to provision a web server. The web server should meet the following requirements:
- Use a Linux-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS) of your choice.
- Install and configure web server software (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
- Secure the web server with SSL/TLS encryption (using self-signed certificates is acceptable).
- Configure firewall rules to allow HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) traffic.
- Automate the deployment and configuration of the web server using your chosen tool.

## Task 2: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Implement a basic CI/CD pipeline using the version control system (VCS) and CI/CD tool of your choice (e.g., Git, Jenkins, Travis CI). The pipeline should include the following steps:
- Whenever a change is pushed to the repository, the pipeline should trigger an automated build process.
- The build process should include any necessary steps for compiling, testing, and packaging the application (assume a simple Hello World web application).
- After a successful build, the application should be deployed to the web server provisioned in Task 1.
- The pipeline should be configured to run on every push to the main branch.

## Task 3: Monitoring and Logging

Implement a basic monitoring and logging solution using a tool of your choice (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack).
- Monitor the web server created in Task 1 and collect relevant metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage, response time).
- Visualize the collected metrics in a dashboard.
- Set up logging to capture application logs and store them centrally for easy access and analysis.

## Task 4: Kubernetes and Microservices Architecture

To create a microservice-centric application, set up Kubernetes services for local development.
- Deploy an application that acts as a mediator between a client and your local system so that your local environment will communicate with the mediator and the mediator will send the appropriate response to the client application.

Please refer to each task's corresponding sections for detailed instructions, configuration files, and scripts related to the implementation.
